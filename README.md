# ChocoBiz-Analytics
This is my first ever power BI project and with my current hands-on knowledge, I did my best.

This Power BI project presents a sales dashboard with key insights into sales performance, revenue generation, and geographical sales distribution. The dashboard provides interactive visualizations to analyze trends and make data-driven decisions.

I created interactive slicer for dynamic filtering of chocolate sales data in different countries, designed various visualizations including bar charts, line graphs, and maps, sorted and filtered top 10 values for salespersons and best-selling chocolates, etc.

## Features
- Top 10 Salespersons by Revenue: A horizontal bar chart displaying the highest revenue-generating salespersons.
- Shipments Made by Salespersons: A bar chart showing the number of shipments completed by each salesperson.
- Sales Distribution by Country: A grouped bar chart representing the total sales in different countries.
- Monthly Sales Trends: A line chart showing the fluctuation of sales across different months, highlighting the lowest sales month.
- Top 10 Highest Revenue-Generating Chocolates by Country: A visualization of the best-selling chocolates and their revenue contribution across different countries.
- Geographical Insights: A map visualization highlighting sales performance in various regions.

## Key Insights
- Ches Bonnell is the highest revenue-generating salesperson with 321K in revenue.
- February had the lowest sales, indicating a potential seasonal impact.
- Australia leads in sales distribution among the listed countries.
- Eclairs is the highest revenue-generating chocolate in INDIA, followed by Peanut Butter Cubes.
